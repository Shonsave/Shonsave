- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shonsave
- 👀 I’m interested in small and simple programs that make small, but noticable differences in life. 
- 🌱 I’m currently giving a shot at multiple programming languages, and trying to make small things to make my life easier. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on relatively small projects that are useful tools used daily
